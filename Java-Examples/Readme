This repository is a collection of Java programs and exercises that I am working on while following this Java tutorial series on YouTube. 
Each folder contains code snippets and example programs that demonstrate different Java concepts.

Repository Structure
BasicSyntax: Contains examples of basic Java syntax, including variables, control flow statements, and fundamental programming concepts.
ObjectOrientedProgramming: Demonstrates object-oriented programming principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
DataStructures: Covers common data structures like arrays, lists, and maps, with examples on how to use them.
Algorithms: Includes implementations of common algorithms such as sorting, searching, and recursion.
